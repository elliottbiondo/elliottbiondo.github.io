<h4>One-sentence summary</h4>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>

The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) matrix factorization technique is shown
to reduce RAM requirements for radiation transport simulation parameters by an
order of magnitude, demonstrated using a realistic nuclear reactor problem on
the Summit supercomputer.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h4>SVD basics</h4>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization method that has
applications in data compression and categorization problems.  For an $m \times
n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ the SVD is

$$
\mathbf{A}_{m \times n} 
= \mathbf{U}_{m \times m} \mathbf{\Sigma}_{m \times n} \mathbf{V}_{n \times n}^T,
$$

where $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix. In this diagonal matrix, the entries
decrease monotonically. As a result, an estimate of $A$ can be formed by
truncating the $\mathbf{U}$, $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, and $\mathbf{V}$ matrices.
Specifically, an estimate of the $a_{ij}$ entry in the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix can be obtained via:

$$
a_{ij} \approx \sum_{k=1}^K u_{ik} \sigma_{kk} v_{jk},
$$

with $1 < K < n$. In other words, an estimate of the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix &mdash;
referred to as a "reconstruction" &mdash; can be obtained by storing only
the first $K$ rows in $\mathbf{U}$, the first $K$ entries along the diagonal of
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$, and the first $K$ columns in $\mathbf{V}$, which results in
a factor of $\Gamma$ memory savings, where $\Gamma$ is given by

$$
\Gamma = \frac{mn}{mK + K + nK}.
$$

For example, consider the following $1,333 \times 1,000$ pixel image of an cave
waterfall in Jackson County, AL:

<img  src="html/projects/svd/files/rank_full.png" alt="" height="30%" width="30%" class="center" style="padding:20px;"/>

This image can be represented by a $1,333 \times 1000$ matrix with entries
representing the color of each pixel (gray-scale values between 0 and 1).
Three reconstructions of this image are shown below.

<img  src="html/projects/svd/files/three_ks.png" alt="" height="80%" width="80%" class="center" style="padding:20px;" />

The $K=100$ reconstruction provides a fairly accurate representation of the
image and requires $M=5.71$ times less memory. This technique has previously
been for a variety of scientific applicaitons including bioinformativs, signal
processing, and nuclear reactor noise analysis.

<h4>Application of SVD to radiation transport</h4>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>

Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport calculations are used to assess the safety
and performance of nuclear reactors and other nuclear systems. This method uses
a random walk technique to simulate the paths particles (i.e., neutrons or
photons), take as they move through a nuclear system, from birth (via fission
or an extermal source) to termination (through absorption reactions or by
leaving the geomtry bounds). Particle paths are recorded as they move through
regions of interest, known as tallies. By simulating a large number of
particles, statiscal methods can be used to estimate radiological quantities
such as particle flux, biological dose rate, and reactions rates within these
tallies. 

<p>

One significant downside of MC radiation transport is when tallies are located
in regions of low particle flux (i.e., regions that few particles pass
through), the convergence rates of tallies may be prohibitively low.  To
address this problem most MC codes employ a class of biased random sampling
techniques known as MC variance reduction (VR).  VR method allow the code to
drastically increase the fraction of compute time spent simulating particles
that are likely to reach the tally, without introducing systematic bias into
the tally results.

<p>

Industry-standard VR methods require a low-order estimate of the adjoint flux
distribution, which describes the "importance" of position/energy phase space
regions to the final result. This information is supplied via "importance
maps": 3D spatial meshes with each mesh volume element tagged with an
energy-wise adjoint fluxes.  These important maps require a significant amount
of RAM, which can limit the fidelity of the simulation that can be achieved.

<p>

SVD can be used to compress importance maps for reduced memory requirements. In
the example above, the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix represents the two spatial
dimensions of the waterfall image.  In this work, the 3 spatial dimensions of
the importance maps are collapsed such that the 2 dimensions of the
$\mathbf{A}$ matrix represent space and energy. This allows an $A$ matrix to be
formulated as:

$$   \mathbf{A}  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \phi^{\dagger \, g = 0}_{c = 0} &  \phi^{\dagger \, g = 1}_{c = 0} & \dots &  \phi^{\dagger \, g = N_g - 1}_{c = 0} \\[0.3cm]
    \phi^{\dagger \, g = 0}_{c = 1} &  \phi^{\dagger \, g = 1}_{c = 1} & \dots &  \phi^{\dagger \, g = N_g - 1}_{c = 1} \\[0.3cm]
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\[0.3cm]
    \phi^{\dagger \, g = 0}_{c = N_{c} - 1} &  \phi^{\dagger \, g = 1}_{c = N_{c} - 1} & \dots &  \phi^{\dagger \, g = N_g - 1}_{c = N_{c} - 1} \\[0.3cm]
  \end{bmatrix},
$$

where $\phi^{\dagger}$ denotes the adjoint flux, $g$ denotes the energy group
index, and $c$ denotes the spatial index. Since adjoint flux distributions may
vary by ten orders of magnitude or more, and SVD in log-space was also considered, i.e.,

$$
   \mathbf{A}  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = 0}_{c = 0}\right) &  \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = 1}_{c = 0}\right) & \dots &  \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = N_g - 1}_{c = 0}\right) \\[0.3cm]
    \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = 0}_{c = 1}\right) & \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = 1}_{c = 1}\right) & \dots &  \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = N_g - 1}_{c = 1}\right) \\[0.3cm]
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\[0.3cm]
    \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = 0}_{c = N_{c} - 1}\right) & \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = 1}_{c = N_{c} - 1}\right) & \dots & \log\left(\phi^{\dagger \, g = N_g - 1}_{c = N_{c} - 1}\right) \\[0.3cm]
  \end{bmatrix}.
$$

By storing the truncated SVDs of these $\mathbf{A}$ matricies, rather than the
full matrices themselves, a signicant amount of RAM can be saved. Values of the
adjoint flux can the be reconstructed on-the-fly (i.e., during a simulation).
Both formulations were implemented and performance tested in the <a

radiation transport code.

<h4>Test problem</h4>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>

The Westinghouse AP1000 is a Generation III+ nuclear reactor design currently
being constructed at several sites in in the US and China. SVD compression of
importance maps was tested for the excore dosimetry problem shown below.  This
problem consists of a quarter-core model with reflecting boundaries, and a
spherical neutron detector in the excore region (i.e., the region outside the
reactor core), on the $z$-midplane. The image on the left shows a $z$-midplane
slice of this geometry, with the detector shown in green. The image on the
right shows the neutron source distribution from fisison. The objective of the
problem is to transport particles from the fission source, through excore
sheilding, to the detector, which serves as a tally.

The Denovo 3D discrete ordainates (S$_N$) code used to obtain an adjoint flux
distribution (importance map) on a 44 $\times$ 44 $\times$ 49 spatial mesh with 28
energy groups. The contour plot below shows the adjoint flux for the
1.4227â€“1.8268 MeV energy group (i.e., fission neutrons). This plot shows that
fission neutrons experience more than 6 orders of magnitude of attenuation
between the source and detectors, which indicates that VR will be necessary.

Because 28 energy groups were used, the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix has an $n$ of 28.
Shift was run using $K = [1, 28]$ with the SVD performed in both linear and log
space. Ten independent trials were run for each $K$. Each trial was run on the
<a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/">Summit supercomputer</a> on 264
nodes with 7 processes per node (due to memory constraints).  The plot below
shows the speedups and corresponding standard deviations for these trials, were
the speedup is defined as the ratio of the convergence rate with VR, to the
convergence rate without VR.

This plot shows that two best options are 1) use a rank $K=1$ approximation
with linear SVD, which provides a $\Gamma \approx 28$ while incurring a
$\sim3\times$ performance penalty, or 2) Use a $K=2$ approximation with a log
SVD, which only reduces the memory required to store the WWs by a factor of
14.* The results show that taking the SVD of the adjoint flux is an effective
method for reducing the memory requirements of importance maps without a
significant sacrifice in performance.

* Note for the nuclear engineering audience: this work using the CADIS method and these $\,\Gamma$ values refer only to weight windows. For the $K=1$ SVD in linear space, the biased source can also be compressed by a factor of 28, but for the $K=2$ SVD in log space, the biased source cannot be compressed. These detailed were ommited for brevity. A full explaination is found in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anucene.2020.107327">journal article</a> .
