			      <h3>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of Monte Carlo variance reduction parameters*</h3>

<h4>SVD basics</h4>

<p>
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization method that has
applications in data compression and categorization problems.  For an $m \times
n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ the SVD is

$$\mathbf{A}_{m \times n}  = \mathbf{U}_{m \times m} \mathbf{\Sigma}_{m \times n} \mathbf{V}_{n \times n}^T,$$

where $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix. In this diagonal matrix, the entries
decrease monotonically. As a result, an estimate of $A$ can be formed by
truncating the $\mathbf{U}$, $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, and $\mathbf{V}$ matrices.
Specifically, an estimate of the $a_{ij}$ entry in the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix is

$$a_{ij} \approx \sum_{k=1}^K u_{ik} \sigma_{kk} v_{jk}.$$

In other words, an estimate of the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix &mdash; referred to as a
"reconstruction" &mdash; can be obtained by storing only the first $K$ rows in
$\mathbf{U}$, the first $K$ entries along the diagonal of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$,
and the first $K$ columns in $\mathbf{V}$, which may result in significant
memory savings. For example, consider the following $211 \times 340$ pixel
image of an eye.

This image can be represented by a $211 \times 340$ matrix with entries
representing the color of each pixel (gray-scale values between 0 and 1).
Three reconstructions of this image are shown below.

The $K=20$ reconstruction provides a fairly accurate representation of the image and requires an order of magnitude less storage.

<h4>Nuclear engineering application</h4>
<p>

Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations are used to assess the safety and
performance of nuclear reactors and other nuclear systems. These calculations
generally employ a class of techniques known as Monte Carlo variance reduction
in order to obtain results in reasonable CPU times. Variance reduction
techniques require "importance maps" to be stored in memory. These maps
estimate how important different regions of space (i.e. elements of a 3D mesh)
and energy are to the final solution. This requires a significant amount of
RAM, which can limit the fidelity of the simulation that can be achieved.

<br>

SVD can be used to compress the importance maps for reduced memory
requirements. In the example above, the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix represents the two
spatial dimensions of the eye image. Importance maps generally have 4
dimensions: $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-position, and energy. In this work, the 3
spatial dimensions are collapsed such that the the 2 dimensions of the
$\mathbf{A}$ matrix represent space and energy. A Python program was created in
order to decomposed these matrices using the <a
href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.svd.html">SciPy
implementation of SVD</a>.

While this work is still in progress, some preliminary analysis was done using a 
<a href="https://holtecinternational.com/productsandservices/wasteandfuelmanagement/dry-cask-and-storage-transport/hi-storm/">Holtec HI-STORM MPC</a> spent nuclear fuel storage cask with a simple photon source and photon detector, shown below. Note that this is a 2-D slice through a cylindrical fuel cask.

This problem used 1,922,000 spatial divisions (124$\times$124$\times$125) and
19 energy divisions. With this problem, an importance map was generated,
decomposed, and then reconstructed with all values of $K$ between 1 and 19 (the
full matrix). These reconstructed importance maps are shown below. Note these
are 2-D slices through the cylindrical fuel cask through the $z$-axis. Two
different energies are shown: $10-20$ Mega-electronvolts (MeV) and $100-200$
kilo-electronvolts (keV).

These plots qualitatively show that even $K = 1$ reconstructions match the
original importance map fairly well. The match is better at higher energies,
because at low energies the spatial shape of the importance map has a steeper
curvature.  In order to quantify how compressing these importance maps affects
performance, the standard Monte Carlo figure of merit was used, as given by

$$ {\text{figure of merit}} = \frac{1}{R^2t_{\text{proc}}}. $$

Here, $t_{\text{proc}}$ is the CPU time and $R$ is the relative error of the
final answer (i.e. the photon flux in the detector). For each
set of reconstructed importance maps, variance reduction parameters were
generated and photon transport simulations were run. The figure of merit plotted
as a function of $K$ is shown below.

The line of best fit of this plot has a slope of 0.071, which indicates that
the performance of the Monte Carlo simulation is not a strong function of the
$K$ value used to reconstruct the importance map. The line of best fit
indicates that by using a $K=1$ reconstruction, the performance is only reduced
by a factor of 1.6, while reducing the memory requirements by a factor of 19.
This is a promising preliminary result and I will be publishing on more
detailed results shortly.
