<h4>One-sentence summary</h4>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>

The Shift Monte Carlo radiation transport code was modified to support
computational geometries specified using an arbitrary combination of Constructive Solid
Geometry (CSG) and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h4>Computational Geometries</h4>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>

Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport simulations are used to assess the safety
and performance of nuclear reactors and other nuclear systems.  This method
involves simulating the paths of particles (i.e., neutrons and/or photons) as
they move through a nuclear system. By simulating a large number of
particles, statistical methods can be used to estimate radiological quantites
such as particle flux, biological dose rate, and the neutron multiplication
factor (which determines if a reactor is subcritical, critical, or
supercritical).

<p>

MC codes track the movement of particles within a computational geometry using
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/discover/ray-tracing">ray tracing</a>,
the same algorithm used for rendering 3D graphics. The implementation of the ray
tracing algorithm depends on how the computational geometry is specificed.
Production-level MC codes typically have ray tracing routines that operate on
models specified in the following formats:

<ol type="1">
<li>Combinatorial Solid Geometry (CSG): geometry cells are specified by combining geometric primitives (e.g., planes,
cuboids, and spheres) using Boolean logic operations, in a text-based format.</li>
<li>Computer-Aided Design (CAD): the boundaries of geometry cells are specified using surface meshes with triangular elements.</li>
</ol>

<p>

There are significant human effort and performance trade-offs between these formats, and as a result, both are widely used.
However, it can be extremely tedious and time-consuming to combine models in
different formats.

<h4>Layered Geometry</h4>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>

Shift is a production-level MC code developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
designed to scale from laptops to supercomputers.  A new "layered" geometry
type has been implemented in the Shift MC radiation transport code. With
layered geometry, CAD and CSG models can be arbitrarily translated, rotated,
clipped, and placed in overlapping layers, as seen in the example below.  New
ray tracing routines have been added to Shift in order to track particles
within layered geometries. This drastically reduces the human effort required
to combine models in multiple formats.

<h4>Demonstration</h4>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>

The layered geometry feature within the Shift MC code was demonstrated with a 
<a href="https://tcr.ornl.gov/">Transformational Challenge Reactor (TCR)</a> problem. As seen in the diagram below, a layered geometry was created by overlaying complex CAD models of fuel and reflector elements over a CSG core model to form a transport-ready geometry.

A <i>k</i>-eigenvalue calculation was carried out on this layered geometry. The converged neutron source and neutron flux distributions appear below.
