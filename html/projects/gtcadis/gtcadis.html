</p><h4>One-sentence summary</h4><p>

Stocastic radiation transport simulations are optimized for an important
nuclear fusion analysis scenario in which neutrons generate radioisotopes in
structural materials, resulting in a prolonged source of potentially harmful
gamma radiation.

</p><h4>Theory</h4><p>

One of the challenges of designing and operating nuclear fusion reactors (such
as <a href="https://www.iter.org/mach">ITER</a>) is the creation of radioactive
materials. For most viable nuclear fusion fuels, the process of fusing atomic
nuclei releases high-energy neutrons.  These neutrons can penetrate through the
structural materials of the reactor and convert normally harmless materials
such as the iron in stainless steel or the hydrogen in water into radioactive
isotopes.  Even after the reactor is switched off, these isotopes will persist
and emit high-energy photons (gamma rays) as they decay.
Some of these photons travel to areas where people may be taking measurements
or doing maintenance, so it is necessary to estimate the potential biological
dose rate. This is generally done using Monte Carlo radiation transport, which
involves simulating the paths that particles take as they move through the
reactor and interact with the materials. 

<br><br>

From the standpoint of computer processing power, these calculations are not
possible without employing a class of techniques known as Monte Carlo variance
reduction.  Variance reduction techniques are used to optimize Monte Carlo
transport by first finding an approximate solution to an adjoint formulation of
the problem (though not all techniques are explicitly formulated this way).
This is done with respect to a detector response function. In terms of a
standard optimization problem, the variance of the detector response function
can be thought of as an objective function that should be minimized.  For decay
photons, defining this detector response function is straightforward, as I
demonstrated in earlier work <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fusengdes.2016.03.004">[2017 journal
article]</a>.  For the neutrons that produce the decay photons, this process is
much more complicated.

<br><br>

As a component of my dissertation work I developed and implemented a technique
for automatically generating the neutron detector response function in order to
optimize Monte Carlo radiation transport for the aforementioned neutron problem.
The most difficult part of forming this function was approximating the process of "neutron activation"
in which material exposed to neutrons creates a vast network of radioactive 
products. For example when $^{62}\mathrm{Ni}$ is exposed to neutrons, the following reactions, and many more, occur:

$$
{^{62}\mathrm{Ni}}
\xrightarrow{\textrm{(n, $\alpha$)}}
{^{59}\mathrm{Fe}}
\xrightarrow{\beta^-}
{^{59}\mathrm{Co}}
\begin{array}{ll}
\xrightarrow{\textrm{(n, $\gamma$)}}
{^{60}\mathrm{Co}} \\
\xrightarrow{\textrm{(n, $\gamma$)}}
{^{60\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Co}}
\xrightarrow{\mathrm{IT}}
{^{60}\mathrm{Co}}
\end{array}
$$

In general, composition of materials before and after nuclear irradiation can be
related via the matrix exponential equation:

$$ \vec{N}(t) = e^{\mathbf{A}t} \vec{N}_0,$$

where $\vec{N}_0$ and $\vec{N}(t)$ are vectors describing the composition of a
material before and after neutron irradiation for time $t$. The $\mathbf{A}$ is
a matrix of reaction rates that depend on the rate in which neutrons pass
through a given area (the neutron flux). I developed a set of approximations
that can be used to simplify this matrix exponential such that it becomes a
linear operator with respect to neutron flux.  The details of this process can
be found in my dissertation/journal article linked at the top of this page, but
just for fun I will show the final answer for the optimal neutron detector
response function ($q^+_n$) that results from the approximation of
$\mathbf{A}$:

$$
\begin{align}
q^+_n(E_n, E_p) = \int_{E_p} \text{d}{E_p} \phi^+_p(E_p)
\sum\limits_{c} \lambda_{c, i_c} b_{c, i_c}(E_p)  N_{c,1}(0)  \Bigg\lbrack \Big\lbrack &\sigma_{c, 1 \rightarrow 2}(E_n) \frac{t_{\text{irr}}^{i_c-1}}{(i_c-1)!} \prod\limits_{j=3}^{i_c}  P_{c, j} \Big\rbrack e^{-d_{c, i_c} t_{\text{decay}}}\\
& + \sum_{j=2}^{i_c-1}  \Big\lbrack \sigma_{c, 1 \rightarrow 2}(E_n) \frac{t_{\text{irr}}^{j-1}}{(j-1)!} \prod\limits_{k=3}^{j}  P_{c, k}  \Big\rbrack B_{c,i_c,j}(t_{\text{decay}}) \Bigg\rbrack.
\end{align}
$$

</p><h4>Demonstration</h4><p>

Here I'll show that my method, which is called Groupwise Transmutation
Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (GT-CADIS) improves the
convergence rate of Monte Carlo neutron transport by a factor of $O(10^2)$
relative to the industry-standard method known as Forward-Weighted (FW)-CADIS.
Consider a simple problem shown below consisting of a block of stainless steel
(gray) with a U-shaped air-duct, a neutron source (blue) and a region (orange)
where we'd like to estimate the biological dose rate from photons after neutron
irradiation.

Using FW-CADIS, neutron detector response function is shown below.

<img  src="html/projects/gtcadis/files/fwcadis_adj_n_src.png" alt="" height="50%" width="50%" class="center" style="padding:20px;"/>

Recall that the variance of this function can be thought of as the guess for
the objective function. With GT-CADIS, the neutron detector response function
has a much different shape: the intensity is much higher in the regions of
stainless steel that border the air duct. Note that only the shape is important here, not the magnitude (or even units!).

<img  src="html/projects/gtcadis/files/gtcadis_adj_n_src.png" alt="" height="50%" width="50%" class="center" style="padding:20px;"/>

I generated variance reduction parameters using both detector response
functions and tracked the rate of convergence of Monte Carlo simulations using
each set.  The image below shows the relative error in the neutron flux as a
function of neutron transport processor time using GT-CADIS and FW-CADIS
variance reduction parameters, as well as no variance reduction. Without
variance reduction, the neutron flux converges fastest near the source. With
FW-CADIS the neutron flux converges at a roughly uniform rate throughout the
problem. With GT-CADIS, the neutron flux converges fastest in the area
immediately surrounding the area of interest, as expected.

In order to quantify how much faster the simulation converges with GT-CADIS, the Monte Carlo figure of merit was used, as defined by 

$$ {\text{figure of merit}} = \frac{1}{R^2t_{\text{proc}}}, $$

where R is the relative error of the photon flux in the region of interest
(e.g. the orange sphere in the geometry image) and $t_{\text{proc}}$ is the
neutron transport processor time. The figure of merit converges to a constant
value during a simulation, as seen in the plot below.

<img  src="html/projects/gtcadis/files/fom_big.png" alt="" height="50%" width="50%" class="center" style="padding:20px;"/>

The ratio of figure of merits is the speedup. GT-CADIS was found to provide
speedups of $200 \pm 100$ relative to FW-CADIS and $9 \pm 5 \times 10^5$
relative to simulations without variance reduction. In other words, GT-CADIS
drastically reduces the required computational resources necessary for
calculating these photon dose rates.
