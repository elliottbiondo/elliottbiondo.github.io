			      <h4>Herald: a Python tool for automatically generating family trees</h4>
			      <p>

I have been researching my genealogy as a hobby for the past 5 years or so.
I've accrued information on hundreds of direct ancestors going back as far as
William the Conqueror (c. 1028 - 1087). There are tons of genealogy tools out
there, but none of them were entirely satisfactory to me. In the throes of
writing my dissertation I needed a fun coding project, so I threw this together
in a few Sunday mornings. This project, which I call Herald, is written in
Python. Herald reads text-based input files and creates
PDF output files via SVG.  This is an ongoing project, so right now only direct
decent is supported (i.e.  parent, grand-parent, ...,
[$N\times$great]-grand-parent).

I came up with a very simple recursive algorithm for generating the tree (which
is appropriately a tree in the graph-theory sense).

<pre><code>
<number>1</number>     <em>function</em> <var>assign_index</var>(Person person, string index)
<number>2</number>         person.set_index(index)
<number>3</number>     
<number>4</number>             <em>if</em> person.mother():
<number>5</number>                 <var>assign_index</var>(person.mother(), person.index() +'1')
<number>6</number>             <em>end if</em>
<number>7</number>     
<number>8</number>             <em>if</em> person.father():
<number>9</number>                 <var>assign_index</var>(person.father, person.index() + '0')
<number>10</number>            <em>end if</em>
<number>11</number>    
<number>12</number>    <em>end function</em>
</code></pre>
<p>

This function is called from the root of the tree (e.g. the person whose
ancestor's you'd like to plot). Each person in the tree is assigned an index
string. The length of the string is the generation they belongs to. For
example, <code>'010'</code> denotes the father's mother's father
(great-grandfather) of the root person. The generation that this person belong
to is <code><em>len</em>('101') = 3</code>. In typical family trees, the
left-most branch is the paternal line (i.e. '0000...0') and the right-most
branch is the maternal line (i.e. '1111...1'). When printing a family tree,
members of a given generation can be sorted from left to right by simply
converting index values to binary (e.g. <code>'1101' = 13</code>) and sorting
using the decimal representation. A portion of my family tree is shown below.
