Nuclear systems analysis often involves using the Monte Carlo approach to
simulate the paths that particles (i.e. neutrons and high-energy photons) take
after they are emitted from a source. This source may be a reactor core,
particle accelerator, or a radioactive seed used in radiation oncology. When
using the Monte Carlo approach, the source must be represented as a probability
density function (PDF) that typically varies as a function of position and
energy (i.e. energy of the emitted particle).  With-industry standard Monte
Carlo radiation transport codes such as <a
href="https://mcnp.lanl.gov/mcnp5.shtml">MCNP5</a>, users must specify these
PDFs through the combination of rudimentary 1-dimensional PDFs such has
histogram, linear, and point-wise distributions.  There are many cases when the
PDF is too complex for this method to be practical, such as cases where
particles are emitted from nuclear fusion plasmas or irradiated structural
materials.

<br><br>

I have added code to the <a href="https://github.com/pyne/pyne">Python for
Nuclear Engineering</a> toolkit for the creation of energy-dependent Cartesian-
or tetrahedral mesh-based PDFs. These PDF can be sampling using unbiased and
biased sampling techniques that allow for the use of Monte Carlo variance
reduction. Sampling is done using the <a
href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4245054/?reload=true">Alias
method</a>, which allows for O(1) scaling with respect to the number of
discrete bins in the PDF. My code is written in C++ and also has Python and
Fortran interfaces and can be compiled directly into existing Monte Carlo codes.
More information can be found in the links at the top of this page.

Here's a quick demonstration of how this code can be used to create extremely
complex particle sources.  Consider this CAD model of a turbine rotor I found on
<a href="https://grabcad.com/">GrabCAD</a>.

I created a conformal tetrahedral mesh of this model using <a
href="https://cubit.sandia.gov/">CUBIT</a>. I then iterated through tetrahedral
elements of the mesh and assigned a source strength to each element based on the
$x$, $y$, $z$ coordinates of the center of the element using this equation:


$$q(x, y, z) = sin\left(\frac{x^2 + y^2 + (z + 10)^2}{1200}\right) + 1.$$

This equation does not have any physical significance, but it serves as a good
example because it would not be possible to represent using industry-standard
Monte Carlo codes. The resulting particle source PDF is shown below.

I compiled my C++ routine directly into MCNP via the Fortran interface I
created. I was then able to use the PDF shown above as a particle source for a
photon transport simulation. Below is an image showing the photon flux
distribution.

Although this example was just for fun, I have used this code as a component of
a software system I created for estimating biological dose rates for nuclear
fusion reactors problems <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fusengdes.2016.03.004">[2016
